Joe Branson: Hey there! Welcome to Psyche. I hope the shuttle ride over here wasn't ASTRONOMICALLY long. I'm Joe Branson, the big cheese of Zephyr Express.
Joe Branson: Anyway, lets get you started. First things first. You're going to need a ship. Go ahead and look over in the hangar and pick one you like.

Joe Branson: Good choice! That's one mighty fine ship. You could say...it's out of this world.
Joe Branson: You're first task is to take this shipment of unicorn horns over to Neo Houston Base on the other side of the asteroid.
Joe Branson: Those fancy researchers over there need it for something. Bob will load'em up for you at light speed.
Joe Branson: Okay, you're all set. Now these things will be ruined if you take too long or if they get too damaged. So make sure you get there on time and avoid crashing. into anything!
Joe Branson: Time to get going! I need my space now.
