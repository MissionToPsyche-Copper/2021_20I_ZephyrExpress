    "",
    "Jo Branson: Good choice! That's one mighty fine ship. You could say...it's out of this world.",
    "Jo Branson: You're first task is to take this shipment of unicorn horns over to Neo Houston Base on the other side of the asteroid.",
    "Jo Branson: Those fancy researchers over there need it for something. Bob will load'em up for you at light speed.",
    "Jo Branson: Okay, you're all set. Now these things will be ruined if you take too long or if they get too damaged. So make sure you get there on time and avoid crashing.",

    "Cameron O'Dorr: These things are really rare. There aren't many unicorns out here out here in these parts so when they shed their horns it gives us a really cool opportunity to learn about these magnificent creatures.",
    "Cameron O'Dorr: I'm not going to take up anymore of your time. We need you to take these fuel cells out to New Anchorage Base. It gets really cold out there during this time of year and they're running low on their heating supplies!",
    "James Brian: Hey, it's you newbies from Zephyr Express.",
    "James Brian: The name's James Brian. That's right, I've got two first names because I'm always first.",
    "James Brian: Looks like they gave you the easy mission. We're hauling tricky cargo over here at Versatile Express.",

    "James Brian: Later.",
    "Cameron O'Dorr: Don't listen to them, Zephyr Express is a great delivery company.",
    "Cameron O'Dorr: You might want to get going though. New Anchorage Base really does need those fuel cells.",
    "Jo Branson: Hey, before your crew takes off, Bob says the ship's health system is damaged.",
    "Jo Branson: It looks like the ship's health won't increase past 1.",
    "Jo Branson: I've never heard of unicorn horns messing with a ship's systems.",
    "Jo Branson: It's a little strange. No one messed with your ship, right?",

    "Kris Schmeichel: Here Zephyr, hurry up and take these matured dragon eggs out to Old Forge Junction. They have to get there before they hatch otherwise you're going to have one fun time with a bunch of baby dragons on your ship.",

    "James Brian: I didn't think that rusty ship of yours would actually make it out here.",

    "Jo Branson: Something has to be messing with your ship. We've never had that many problems on the same day!",

    "Jo Branson: I can't believe you managed to make all those deliveries even with all of the damage the ship sustained.",
    "Jo Branson: If you ask me, it was Versatile Express trying to make sure they won delivery company of the year.",
